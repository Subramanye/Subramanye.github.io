## Welcome !

I am a research student at the [Physical Research Laboratory](https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/), where my work primarily focuses on numerical modeling of planetary surface processes. My recent research involves modeling impact craters in the lunar south pole's permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) using the [iSALE-2D](https://isale-code.github.io/) code. I also worked on estimating impact crater ejecta thickness for the Chandrayaan-3 landing site, with our current work under revision.

I hold a postgraduate diploma in Space and Atmospheric Science from the Physical Research Laboratory, where I have developed strong skills in programming (Python), numerical modeling (iSALE-2D), and data analysis. 

Prior to Physical Research Laboratory, I did my master thesis at Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore on the optical properties of Type Iax supernovae with Prof. G. C. Anupama and Prof. D.K. Sahu. I am an alumnus of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India, where I earned my M.Sc. in Physics in 2023.
