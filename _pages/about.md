Hi, there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Rama. I am a research intern at the [Physical Research Laboratory](https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/) in the department of Planetary Sciences, where my work primarily focuses on numerical modeling of planetary surface processes, with the supervision of [Prof. Vijayan S](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=c1cA1mcAAAAJ&hl=en). My recent research involves modeling impact craters in the lunar south pole's permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) using the [iSALE-2D](https://isale-code.github.io/) code. I also worked on estimating impact crater ejecta thickness for the Chandrayaan-3 landing site, with our current work accepted for publication.

I hold a postgraduate diploma in Space and Atmospheric Science from the Physical Research Laboratory, where I have developed strong skills in programming (Python), numerical modeling (iSALE-2D), and data analysis. 

Prior to Physical Research Laboratory, I did my master thesis at [Indian Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/), Bangalore on the optical properties of Type Iax supernovae with [Prof. G. C. Anupama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EVjQ--4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. D.K. Sahu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Devendra-Sahu-3). I am an alumnus of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India, where I earned my M.Sc. in Physics in 2023.
